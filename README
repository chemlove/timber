TIMER: a package to simplify setup of TI free energy calculations with AMBER.

Usage:

./timber.py -i mapping.csv -sdf ligand_file.sdf -m setup -ff gaff

    - mapping.csv: CSV file, with header, containing rows of transformations:
		   Name1,Name2
		   benzene,phenol

    - ligand_file.sdf: SDF file containing all ligands. Names must match those in the CSV file.
    
    - setup: this is the mode. Currently, only setup is supported.

    - gaff: AMBER small molecule force field definition. gaff or gaff2.

Output:

    - for each transformation in the CSV file, there will be a directory Name1_Name2.
      Inside, there will be directories "start" (ligand1) and "endpoint" (ligand2),
      each of these will contain small molecule parameters such that the TI region 
      is at the end of the molecule. There will also be "TI_MASK.dat" containing the masks.
